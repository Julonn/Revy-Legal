Revy — Privacy Policy

Last updated: October 14, 2025
This Privacy Policy explains how Revy (“the bot”, “we”, “our”) collects, stores, and uses data when you interact with it on Discord.
By using Revy, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

1. Data We Collect

Revy only stores data that is strictly necessary for the bot’s core functionality.
This includes:
Server ID (to identify where the bot is installed)
Configured channel IDs (to know where to post or manage reviews)
User IDs (to identify who submitted a review)
Review content (ratings and optional text comments)
No sensitive or personally identifiable information (such as email addresses, IPs, or Discord tokens) is ever collected.

2. How We Use the Data

Collected data is used only to:
Display reviews and ratings on your Discord server
Keep configuration settings consistent between bot restarts
Improve the reliability and stability of Revy’s features
We never share, sell, or rent your data to any third party.

3. Data Storage and Security

All stored data is kept in a secure database with restricted access.
Reasonable security measures are taken to prevent unauthorized access or data loss.
However, no online service is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.

4. Data Retention and Deletion

Data is retained only as long as the bot remains on your server.
When you remove Revy from your server, all related data is automatically deleted within a reasonable timeframe.
You may also contact the developer to request manual data deletion.

5. Third-Party Services

Revy does not share data with external services or analytics platforms.
If this changes in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly.

6. Your Rights

You have the right to:
Request access to data stored about your server or account.
Request deletion of your data at any time.
To exercise these rights, please contact the developer via Discord (username: julivs.27).

7. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically.
The “Last updated” date will always reflect the latest version.
Continued use of Revy after updates means you accept the revised policy.
