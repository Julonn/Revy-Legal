Revy — Terms of Service

Last updated: October 14, 2025

Thank you for using Revy, a Discord bot developed by Julius.
Revy allows Discord servers to collect and display user reviews (ratings and comments).

By adding or using Revy on your server, you agree to the following Terms of Service:

1. Usage

Revy is intended for use within Discord only.
You must have the necessary permissions on your server to configure or interact with the bot.
You agree not to abuse the bot or use it for spam, harassment, or any activity that violates Discord’s Terms of Service
 or community guidelines.

2. Data Collected

Revy stores only the data required for its operation:
Discord server ID
Configured channel IDs
Reviews (rating, optional comment, and reviewer’s user ID)
No additional personal information is collected.
All data is used solely to enable the bot’s features and is never shared with third parties.

3. Data Removal

Server administrators can:
Delete reviews directly from Discord.
Remove the bot from their server — this will automatically delete all related data within a reasonable timeframe.

4. Liability

Revy is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind.
The developer is not responsible for data loss, misuse, or service interruptions caused by Discord API issues or user actions.

5. Changes

These Terms of Service may be updated at any time.
Continued use of Revy after changes are published means you accept the updated terms.
